One of the best practices is to add a semi-colon, as many languages require one to finish a line of code.
Name variables what they actually are, don't be dumb and call variables things that don't make sense.
Comment descriptive comments as much as needed, but not more than you have to.
Avoid mixing Javascript with other languages in the same document.
Place script tag at the bottom of the HTML document.
Modularize; Make one function perform one function, not multiple functions.
Use javascript libraries sparingly, try to always use raw javascript.
Declare your variables at the top of the page.
Use === as a strict equals operator.
Declare objects in arrays with const().
